# Optimization-DEMO


This project is a quick demonstration of what I explored at Columbia University during the duration of my stay.

The code has been modified to run in any online IDE that runs Python.

The project uses a simple greedy algorithm that is designed to find the best placements for the 'reactors' based on how much demand it can cover.
It works by first generating a random grid, specified by the user, then it randomly assigns the weight values to each grid, range is specified by user again.
After the user selects the amount of reactors to place, the program runs the greedy algorithm, which essentially simulates planting the reactors in every single grid square until it finds the one that has the most coverage.
